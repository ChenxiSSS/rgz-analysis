rgz-analysis
============

Analysis pipeline for Radio Galaxy Zoo.

Requires:

- mongodb
- Python with numpy, astropy, matplotlib, pandas, pymongo, scipy packages

To set up the pipeline, you will need a download of the database from the Amazon S3 servers. This is obtained via email link; contact the Zooniverse team at Adler for access to this. As of mid-Jan 2016, the database (raw version is a set of JSON files generated by mongoexport) is ~250 MB zipped and ~6 GB when imported into Mongo.

Once the database is downloaded, the pipeline can be run by:

- run a ```mongod``` session on your local machine
- run ```mongoimport``` on all three BSON collection files (radio_classifications, radio_subjects, radio_groups). Example:
    ```mongoimport --db radio --drop --collection radio_subjects radio_2014-01-05/radio_subjects.bson```
- execute ```make_rgz_catalog.sh```
